# Vicinity Set Cover Analysis for Protein-Coding Genes

This notebook provides a solution to the *vicinity set cover problem* using protein-coding genes on a specified chromosome. It identifies a minimal set of reference genes whose surrounding genes (within a given genomic distance) collectively cover the entire set of genes on that chromosome.

## üîß How It Works

The main function:
```python
main(threshold, chromosome)
```
- Loads protein-coding gene data from a `protein2_full.pkl` file.
- Filters genes by the specified chromosome.
- Uses the given threshold (in base pairs) to determine gene neighborhoods (vicinities).
- Solves the vicinity set cover problem to select the minimal set of reference genes that cover all others through their vicinities.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Usage

To run the main function inside the notebook:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Set threshold to 20,000 base pairs
    threshold = 20000

    # Analyze genes on chromosome 1
    chromosome = 'chr1'

    # Run the algorithm
    reference_genes, vicinities_of_reference_genes = main(threshold, chromosome)
```

This will output:
- `reference_genes`: List of selected reference genes.
- `vicinities_of_reference_genes`: List of gene sets around each selected reference gene.

## üìÅ Requirements

- A file named `protein2_full.pkl` containing gene data in a dictionary format.
- Implementations of `get_sets()` and `solve_gene()` must be available in the notebook.

## üí° Notes

- Adjust `threshold` and `chromosome` values to analyze different regions of the genome.
- Make sure all necessary imports (e.g., `pickle`, `numpy`) are included.
